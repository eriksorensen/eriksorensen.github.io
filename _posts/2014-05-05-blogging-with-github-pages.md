title: Blogging With Github Pages and Poole's Hyde Theme
---

_Note: As of 5/5/2014, this post is still a work in progress_


My new blog is built with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using [Poole's](http://getpoole.com/) [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) template and the [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) discussion system.

This article is the first post, and in it I describe how I went from zero to a nice developer web site.
